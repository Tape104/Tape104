<h5>- HRC or "Hidden Research Center" has found 4 audio tapes in many weird places, with weird audio input on</h5>
<h5> them over the last 4 weeks. They are convinced that there are more. We actually managed to get access </h5>
<h5> to the .mp3 recordings of the tapes, and all we can say is that the input is really disdurbing. Some being </h5>
<h5> more unsettling than the last. Though we can't upload the audio files, we have written a representation </h5>
<h5> of each. </h5>

<h4>----(if we get new information on any of the tapes, you will be informed.)----</h4>


<h3>---TAPE ONE---</h3>

<h5> The tape starts with a man (probably from HRC) saying: "Alright. Is it on? Ok. This is the audio of tape one.</h5>
<h5> Go.". </h5>
<h5> The tape starts playing. You can hear the sound of a weird low pitch static for a few seconds, before you</h5>
<h5> hear screams of a man and a woman, also pitched down, almost sounding demonic. You now hear someone</h5>
<h5> talking in russian. One of our teammembers translated it to something like: "You will hear of them,</h5>
<h5> as you go to sleep, as you are awake. An untouched paradise, an alternative to this rotten place.", which </h5>
<h5> than later on loops for 3 minutes straight. After that, the screams of the man and woman are at their regular </h5>
<h5> pitch for exactly 2.35 seconds. Than, the tape ends.</h5>
